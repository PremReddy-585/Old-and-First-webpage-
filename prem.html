                <h2>First Paragraph</h2>
                <p>In Chapter Two we have seen that in a democracy it is neither possible nornecessary  
                    for  people  to  govern  directly.  The  most  common  form  ofdemocracy  in  our  times
                      is  for  the  people  to  govern  through  theirrepresentatives. 
                      In this chapter we will look at how these representativesare elected. 
                      We begin by understanding why elections are necessary anduseful  in  a  democracy.
                        We  try  to  understand  how  electoral  competitionamong  parties  serves  
                        the  people.  We  then  go  on  to  ask  what  makes  anelection  democratic.
                          The  basic  idea  here  is  to  distinguish  democraticelections from non-democratic

                <h2>Second paragraph</h2>
                <p>The rest of the chapter tries to assess elections in India in the light ofthis yardstick. We take a look at each stage of elections, from the drawingof boundaries of different constituencies to the declaration of results. Ateach stage we ask what should happen and what does happen in elections.Towards  the  end  of  the  chapter,  we  turn  to  an  assessment  of  whetherelections in India are free and fair. Here we also examine the role of theElection Commission in ensuring free and fair elections.CHAPTER 4ElectoralPolitics2015-16(19/01/2015)

                <p>The people were unhappy with theexisting government. They were alsoattracted by 
                    Devi Lal's promise. So,when elections were held, they votedoverwhelmingly in favour 
                    of Lok Daland  its  allies.  Lok  Dal  and  itspartners won 76 out of 90 seats inthe
                      State  Assembly.  Lok  Dal  alonewon 60 seats and thus had a clearmajority  in  the  
                      Assembly.  TheCongress could win only 5 seats</p>

                <p>Elections can be held in many ways.All  democratic  countries  holdelections.
                     But most non-democraticcountries  also  hold  some  kind  ofelections.  
                     How  do  we  distinguishdemocratic elections from any otherelection? 
                      We  have  discussed  thisquestion briefly in Chapter Two.

                      they  can  really  be  calleddemocratic  elections.
